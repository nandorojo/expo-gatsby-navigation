# `expo-gatsby-navigation` example ðŸ¤µ

If you're just looking around, there are only two places you need to look to see how the set up works:

-   `App.tsx` file to see mobile code and `react-navigation` set up.
-   `src/pages/` folder to see how routing for gatsby works.

# Run the example

**1. Clone repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-gatsby-navigation
